              <b>5 Eye Care Tips for Beautiful Eyes</b><br/><br/>
                Most people don’t think about their eyes unless they’re putting on makeup. But, eyes need just as much care as skin does. These tips will help you to keep your eyes beautiful, healthy and looking sharp. Caring for your eyes like you do your skin and your face will ensure you look and feel your best.<br/><br/>
                <b>1) Cucumber Slices</b><br/><br/>
                The go-to eye care treatment has been, and conintues to be, cucumber slices. It’s worked for countless movie characters (including a few Bond girls) and comes pretty much standard at most spas.\n\n It is one of the oldest and most effective ways of eliminating those dark circles that creep like shadows on our faces. \n\n Not only do the cucumbers prevent dark circles but they also hydrate the skin to keep it looking fresh.\n\n Cucumbers are also one of the simplest eye care treatments.\n All you have to do is peel, \n slice and place fresh cucumbers on your eyes for fifteen to twenty minutes. In less than a half hour you’re looking and feeling ready to take on the day.<br/><br/>
                <b>2) Vitamin A and Vitamin C</b><br/><br/>
                Proper nutrition is one of the largest contributors to your overall health.\n Your body craves certain vitamins to perform at its best and to keep you looking yours.\n\nThe two types of Vitamins your eyes crave the most are Vitamin A and Vitamin C.\n\nAdd some carrots or squash to your daily routin to boost your Vitamin A levels and your skin’s natural glow. \n\nFor an extra dose of Vitamin C, stock up on citrus fruits or bell peppers and watch the look of your eyes improve right before your eyes. \n\nThe easiest way to keep your eyes looking great is to simply stick to a healthy diet and make sure you’re getting enough of the vitamins your body needs to be at its best.<br/><br/>
                <b>3) Water or Herbal Tea</b><br/><br/>
                Hydration is key. Not only does it help your body and skin but it also helps your eyes. \nYou don’t nessecarily have to stick to eight glasses of ice water a day though. You can always work in some herbal tea. \n\n Teas give you and your skin that extra boost to take care of business and those dark circles. By staying hydrated, your body will stay healthy, your will skin glow, and dark circles will disappear.<br/><br/>
                <b>4) Black/Green Tea Bags</b><br/><br/>
                Feeling a little puffy? There’s a suprising, home remedy for that. Like cucumber slices, cold tea bags can do wonders for your eyes.\n\n Instead of helping with dark circles though, placing cold tea bags on your eyes will elimnate puffiness and let you be your true self in the mirror and all day long.<br/><br/>
                <b>5) Rose Water</b><br/><br/>
                The skin around your eyes are just a part of how you keep you looking like you. When your eyes themselves are in need of a little touch up,\n don’t reach for an over the counter eye drop; restore their natural glow with rose water.\n Rose water has natural properties that can rejuviate your eyes quicker than you can bat an eyelash. One or two drops, at most, can cleanse your eyes and help them sparkle.<br/>

                <b>Don't take your eyes for granted. Take these easy steps to keep your peepers healthy.</b><br/><br/>

                <b>1. Eat Well</b><br/><br/>
Good eye health starts with the food on your plate. Nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, zinc, and vitamins C and E might help ward off age-related vision problems like macular degeneration and cataracts. To get them, fill your plate with:<br/><br/>
•	Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, and collards<br/>
•	Salmon, tuna, and other oily fish<br/>
•	Eggs, nuts, beans, and other nonmeat protein sources<br/>
•	Oranges and other citrus fruits or juices<br/>
•	Oysters and pork<br/>
A well-balanced diet also helps you stay at a healthy weight. That lowers your odds of obesity and related diseases like type 2 diabetes, which is the leading cause of blindness in adults.<br/><br/>
                <b>2. Quit Smoking</b><br/><br/>
                It makes you more likely to get cataracts, damage to your optic nerve, and macular degeneration. If you've tried to kick the habit  before only to start again, keep at it. The more times you try to quit, the more likely you are to succeed. Ask your doctor for help.<br/><br/>
                <b>3. Wear Sunglasses</b><br/><br/>
                The right pair of shades will help protect your eyes from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. Too much UV exposure boosts your chances of cataracts and macular degeneration.
                Choose a pair that blocks 99% to 100% of UVA and UVB rays. Wraparound lenses help protect your eyes from the side. Polarized lenses reduce glare while you drive.<br/>

              Have regular physical exams to check for diabetes and high blood pressure.<br/> If left untreated, these diseases can cause eye problems. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision loss from diabetic \nretinopathy, macular degeneration and eye strokes.<br/><br/>
#. Look for warning signs of changes in your vision. If you start noticing changes in your vision, see your eye doctor immediately.<br/> Some trouble signs to look for are double vision, hazy vision and difficulty seeing in low light conditions. <br/>Other signs and symptoms of potentially serious eye problems that warrant immediate attention include red eyes, \nfrequent flashes of light, floaters, and eye pain and swelling.<br/><br/>
#. Exercise more frequently. According to the AAO, some studies suggest that regular exercise — such as walking — can reduce the risk of \nage-related macular degeneration by up to 70 percent.<br/><br/>
#. Protect your eyes from harmful UV light. When outdoors during daytime, always wear sunglassesthat shield your eyes from \n100 percent of the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. This may help reduce your risk of cataracts, pinguecula and other eye problems.<br/><br/>
#. Eat a healthy and balanced diet. Numerous studies have shown that antioxidants can possibly reduce the risk of cataracts. \n\nThese antioxidants are obtained from eating a diet containing plentiful amounts of fruits and colorful or dark green vegetables.<br/>

                The team in this service diagnose and treats cataract.<br/><br/>
                Cataract surgery is generally recommended when your cataract has progressed to the point that it is interfering with your daily activities and lifestyle.<br/><br/>
                Modern cataract surgery is usually quick and can be performed using a local anaesthetic only. Most people are able to return to work the day after their operation. <br/><br/>During surgery, your lens is usually replaced with a clear artificial lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL). \n\n For most patients, the new lens is chosen to aim for focused distant vision after the operation.<br/> Many people still require glasses for fine focusing in the distance and it is usual for you to need reading glasses after  your operation.<br/><br/>
                Now a days we are using multifocal IOLs for focussing both distance and near and toric IOLs for  correcting astigmatism.<br/>

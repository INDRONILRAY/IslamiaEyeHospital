                After completing undergraduate at DMC in 1997, Dr. Mahmood undertook a fellowship in cornea and anterior segment at Islamia, which included an observership at LV Prasad Eye Institute, India. Among his hundreds of surgeries, a young blind lady was benefitted. As he tells: â€œShe had lost her sight some time before and had never seen her husband. After I performed a corneal graft on one of her eyes, she became sighted could see her husband for the first time. On seeing him, her whole face lit up. I felt as if I had really made a difference to someoneâ€™s life!â€

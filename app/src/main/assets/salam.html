            <p class="text-justify">
                Dr. Salam spent many years working in the rural areas where he felt he could play a major role in preventing people from needless blindness. He has become more dedicated to his patients and looks at his work as a form of worship. In 2001 he started the Fred Hollow Foundation project with Grameen Bank to reduce needless blindness in rural areas. During that time, he went to Nepal on several occasion (2001, 2004, 2006) for training on cataract &amp; oculoplasty surgery. Later he completed his Cornea Fellowship from Islamia.

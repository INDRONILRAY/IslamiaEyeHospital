            <p class="text-justify">
                Before joining Islamia, which he did in 2012, Dr. Zahir completed a yearâ€™s fellowship in general ophthalmology and cataract surgery at Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, India (the largest eye hospital in the world). He has performed over 3,000 ophthalmic surgeries. He relates a story about a patient on whom he performed surgery. â€œShe had been blind with cataracts,â€ Dr. Zahir says, â€œand after the operation, she could see again. For the first time, she saw her 2-year-old child.â€
